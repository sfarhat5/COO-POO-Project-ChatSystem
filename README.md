# **ChatSystem**
 Implementation of a distributed (p2p) chat system. This system allows users to send and receive text messages using interconnected devices. 
, users can also communicate by sending and receiving files (i.e. pictures, documents, programs, etc). 

## *System requirements specification*


* Every user chooses an unused username to connect to the chat system.
* When a user connects to the system, the list of the other connected users is presented.
* Only connected users are able to communicate using the chat system functions.
* When any user logs in  or logs out , the other users get informed about it.
* When a user wants to communicate with another user (send a message or send a file), he has to select the remote user from the connected users' list. 
* When the system receives a message or file targeted to the connected local user, the user has to be notified .

## *How to run the app*

In order to run the java application , you need to :
* Upload the zip file on 2 ( or more ) distinct computers , connected to the same network 
* Execute the command   `java -jar chatsystem.jar` on both devices
